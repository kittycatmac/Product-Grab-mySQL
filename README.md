# Product-Grab-mySQL
This back-end application uses a mySQL database and Node.js to query for products with prompts. Then once the user inputs data the database is updated. 

# Getting Started
Be sure to install Node.js to have the application work. First run the node and the js file to begin. The list of products with department, price and quantity will be listed first. Then there will be prompts to order products. Once the order is placed then cart is listed and the database is updated. The list is then listed again for another purchase.
